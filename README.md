# mtk-linux
This is just some code I have started putting together for flashing my prestigio 5450 DUO(MTxx , Mediatek phone) it will never replace sp lash tool its just I am unable to get the linux version of flash tool working on my system.

My current progress is small I have managed to send the download agent to the device and am able to download from anywhere on phone flash memory I also have code for writing flash and will upload once I have tested

This code requires mtk download agent binary which is distrubuted with sp flash tools I have not uploaded it as I need to check license etc first.

The current code has no command line options at the minute as my intention is to build a gui you would need to edit code to use, if you do decide to use this please do so at your own risk I will not be responsible for any bricked devices
